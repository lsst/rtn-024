\section{Introduction}

The high-level goal is to routinely process a medium dataset at SLAC, in a fully automated way using PanDA.
The scale of medium datasets follows the definitions in \citeds{DMTN-091}.
The first target can be the HSC-RC2 or the DC2-test-med1 datasets that are processed monthly at NCSA currently.

Developers use these routine processings to regularly confirm the state of the DRP pipeline. A good early demonstration of this service at SLAC would bring a number of early Data Facility functions into play. To date, these processings have been done by hand; the goal would be to automate them while using PanDA to drive the workflow. Some early campaign tooling would be needed to orchestrate the set of data needing to be submitted to PanDA by \texttt{ctrl\_bps}.
